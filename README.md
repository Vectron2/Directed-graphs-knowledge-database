# Directed-graphs-knowledge-data-base
A small project in python using pyautogui's msg box built in function 
The photos are located in the images folder, and in order to run the program you have to extract all the images in same folder as the program
You need to install the libraries pyautogui and pillow in order to test this project on your pc, using this command (after you have already instaled pip):

To install pip run (in cmd):

py get-pip.py

To install the libs needed run (in cmd):

py -m pip install pyautogui

py -m pip install pillow

(of course you need python to already be installed on your PC :) )
